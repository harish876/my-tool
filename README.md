Instructions:

Hi so to use this project follow these simple steps:
  1. Clone this repository and type npm install to install all the dependencies.
  2. the syntax for usage is "mytool -u -i filename dependency@version"
  3. the -u is for the update pr feature which is not yet implemented.
  4. the -i feature gets the dependency and version as input and checks for the version.
  5. add all your package.json file to the config folder to check dependencies.
  6. add the test.csv inside the bin folder. Dont give the file extension as .csv. Just file name is enough 
  7. check the result.csv inside the bin folder too
  8. Thats about it. Hope it works. It was a sincere effort. Cheers. Have a good Day.
